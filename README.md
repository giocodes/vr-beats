###VRBeats
--------------------------
A sound clip mixer and visualizer through Node and Express.

**Description**
Used howler.js to process HTML5 audio and three.js to create visualizations matching the beat of user chosen songs.

**Features**
1. Keymapping for 19 different audio clips
2. Supports various audio file types. I found mp3 to be the most efficient when combining multiple sounds simultaniously.
3. Desktop and VR mode
